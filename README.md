# Pairwise-Sequence-Alignment
## Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to compare time cycles taken by the Sequence Alignment problem when solved with serial, openMP and MPI techniques.The time comparisons are also visualized using the matplot.lib from Python.
### Prerequisites and Requirements for Serial Source Code 
Before you can run the program In Serial , you need to : 

    1.Install an IDE and install relevant extensions for C/C++
  
In our case , we have used the DevC++ and Visual Studio Code 2012.
 
You can easily download  IDE's from :
 
*DevC++ IDE : https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/
 
*Visual Studio Code : https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/

####Running Pthreads and OpenMP code :

We have worked on Linux Pthreads and OpenMP so the program shall be executed in any IDE available on linux Operating systems

##### Program Execution 

    -> Write the following command in Terminal for Pthreads:  g++ -o h1 filename.c -lpthread , ./h1
    
    -> Write the following command in Terminal for Pthreads:   g++ -o omp OMP.cpp -fopenmp , ./omp
